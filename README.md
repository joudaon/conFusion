Installing nodeJS
-----------------

To install Node on your machine, go to https://nodejs.org and click on the Download button. Depending on your computer's platform (Windows, MacOS or Linux), the appropriate installation package is downloaded. As an example, on a Mac, you will see the following web page. Click on the Download button. Follow along the instructions to install Node on your machine. (Note: Now Node gives you the option of installing a mature and dependable version and a more newer stable version. You can choose to install the mature and dependable version. I will continue to use this version in the course. You can choose to install the newer stable version if you wish. You may not see any perceptible differences between the two as users).

> **Note:** On Windows machines, you may also to install <i class="icon-provider-github"></i> Git on your machine if you don't have it already installed. Some of the Node based tools that we use later will need <i class="icon-provider-github"></i> Git to be installed. You can download the installer from here.

> **Note:** On Windows machines, you may need to configure your PATH environmental variable in case you forgot to turn on the add to PATH during the installation steps.

Verifying the Node Installation

Open a terminal window on your machine. If you are using a Windows machine, open a cmd window or PowerShell window with admin privileges.
To ensure that your NodeJS setup is working correctly, type the following at the command prompt to check for the version of Node and NPM

```sh
$ node -v
$ 
$ npm -v
```


Implementing a simple Node HTTP Server
--------------------------------------

* Create a file name server.js

```javascript
$ var http = require('http');

var hostname = 'localhost';
var port = 3000;

var server = http.createServer(function(req, res){
  console.log(req.headers);
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
  res.end('<html><body><h1>Hello World</h1></body></html>');
  })
server.listen(port, hostname, function(){
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
``` 

* Run the server 

```sh
$ node server
```

* Type "http://locahost:3000" in the browser and see result

* Also "Postman" (https://www.getpostman.com/) Chrome extension can be used to send requests to the server and see the response
